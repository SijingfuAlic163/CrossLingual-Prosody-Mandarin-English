**Cross-linguistic prosodic variation in read speech from open corpora: A multidimensional acoustic analysis of Mandarin and English**

## Overview

This study investigates multidimensional acoustic prosodic variation between Mandarin Chinese and English using balanced read-speech samples drawn from two publicly available speech corpora.

* **Mandarin Chinese:** AISHELL-1
* **English:** LibriSpeech
* **Mandarin utterances:** 500
* **English utterances:** 500
* **Total utterances:** 1,000
* **Sampling rate:** 16 kHz

A unified computational pipeline is applied to both corpus samples to improve methodological consistency in cross-corpus acoustic comparison.

## Acoustic Features

Seven acoustic measures are analyzed across complementary prosodic dimensions:

### Pitch-related features

* F0 mean
* F0 standard deviation
* F0 range

### Energy-related features

* RMS energy

### Temporal and voicing features

* Duration
* Pause ratio
* Voicing ratio

## Analysis Pipeline

The analysis consists of the following stages:

1. Audio preprocessing
2. Speech segmentation and quality control
3. Acoustic feature extraction
4. Feature normalization
5. Distributional analysis
6. Mann–Whitney U testing
7. Multiple-comparison control
8. Effect-size estimation
9. Principal component analysis (PCA)
10. Linear mixed-effects modeling
11. Figure generation

The same general analytical procedure is applied to the Mandarin and English samples.

## Statistical Analysis

Between-corpus differences are evaluated using nonparametric statistical testing together with effect-size estimation.

Principal component analysis is used to characterize the multidimensional structure of the acoustic feature space.

Speaker-level variability is further considered using a linear mixed-effects model of the general form:

`F0 mean ~ Language + (1 | Speaker)`

Positive effect-size values indicate higher values in the Mandarin sample, whereas negative values indicate higher values in the English sample.

## Main Findings

The analysis identifies systematic acoustic differences between the Mandarin and English corpus samples across multiple prosodic dimensions.

Temporal measures show particularly large between-corpus effects. Duration exhibits the largest absolute effect size (*d* = −2.68), followed by pause ratio (*d* = 1.38). RMS energy also shows a substantial difference (*d* = −1.02), whereas several F0-related measures exhibit comparatively smaller effects.

The first two principal components explain 59.80% of the total variance and reveal partial separation between the two corpus samples within a shared multidimensional acoustic feature space.

Linear mixed-effects analysis further identifies a significant language-associated difference in F0 mean after accounting for speaker-level variability.

## Data Availability

The original speech recordings are not redistributed in this repository.

Mandarin speech data were obtained from the publicly available **AISHELL-1** corpus, and English speech data were obtained from **LibriSpeech**. Users should obtain the original speech data from the respective corpus providers and comply with their applicable licenses and terms of use.

The `data/sample_manifest.csv` file is intended to provide the identifiers and metadata required to reconstruct the subset of utterances analyzed in the study.

## Reproducibility

This repository is designed to provide the preprocessing, acoustic feature extraction, statistical analysis, dimensionality reduction, mixed-effects modeling, and figure-generation procedures associated with the study.

Detailed software dependencies are provided in `requirements.txt`.

## Interpretation

Because AISHELL-1 and LibriSpeech were independently constructed corpora, language-related differences cannot be completely separated from corpus-specific differences in speaker composition, recording conditions, and utterance characteristics.

Accordingly, results from this repository should primarily be interpreted as **corpus-level cross-linguistic acoustic differences**, rather than as direct causal effects of language typology.
